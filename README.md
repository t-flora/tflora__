Hi! This is the source code for my (pretty bare-bones) personal portfolio.
It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

You can access the live version of the main branch of this website on [tiagoflora.com](https://tiagoflora.com).

## Dependencies
- Next.js 13
- Tailwind CSS
- Maybe Three.js, if I could get the builds to work

## Replicate this website
To run this website locally, you can clone this repository and run `npm install && npm run dev` to get a local Node development server up.
