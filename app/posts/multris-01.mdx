## Displaying a basic grid
The most straightforward way to create and display a game grid is to:
1. Specify its size: define a number of columns and rows. A regular Tetris board is 10 x 20, and that should suffice for now. Depending on how many "multiminos" we end up having in any given piece, we might want larger boards.
2. Create a Cell component: a simple `div` containing a marker of cell content (being either part of a block or an empty cell) should be the most basic unit of the board. It can be styled to be a square with color to be defined by the cell content.
3. Define a board component: aggregate Cell components into a matrix (an array of arrays) and display them together.

This should be enough to get us a basic board.

```ts
export default function Cell({ type }: CellProps) {
    return <div className={styles.cell[type]} />;
}
```
